# California_housing
The repository shows my learning journey of the book 'Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and Tensorflow'<br>
The data which I have used is the california housing data to estimate the median housing price in a district.<br>


In my work I have cleaned the data and modelled to train the models.<br>
Different models were compared using cross validations and as well model tuning is achieved for a better performance using the GridSearch.<br>
The repository will be updated regularly to make the notebook easy to understand understand and as well shoe my findings in a report.<br>
Please note that this is a practice for developing my skills comparing to the real world scenario as a Data Scientist, Hence I am open with suggestion and please support me.<br>


Enjoy Data Cleaning!!
